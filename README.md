# A Debian APT repo

This repo contains dae, v2rayA, v2ray, xray and juicity programs.

## Usage

### 1. Add the repository

Sometimes you need to install `curl` and `gpg` at first:

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install curl gpg
```

#### For APT version 3.0 or higher

Add the repository to your sources config:

```sh
cat <<- EOL | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/daeuniverse.sources
Types: deb
URIs: https://daeuniverse.pages.dev
Suites: goose
Components: honk
Signed-By: /usr/share/keyrings/daeuniverse-archive-goose.gpg
EOL
```

#### For APT version lower than 3.0

Add the repository to your sources list:

```sh
cat <<- EOL | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/daeuniverse.list
deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/daeuniverse-archive-goose.gpg] https://daeuniverse.pages.dev goose honk 
EOL
```

### 2. Import the GPG key

```sh
curl -fsSL https://daeuniverse.pages.dev/public-key.asc | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/daeuniverse-archive-goose.gpg
```

### 3. Install packages

Update the package list:

```sh
sudo apt update
```
Install the desired package, for example, v2rayA:

```sh
sudo apt install v2raya
```

## How to edit Systemd Service

If you want to edit the systemd service file, you can just run(for example, for `daed` service):

```sh
sudo systemctl edit --full daed.service
```

New file will be placed in `/etc/systemd/system/daed.service`, instead of in `/lib/systemd/system/daed.service`, and new file will not be overwritten when package is updated.

## Let v2rayA use v2ray as its core

Defaultly v2rayA uses xray as its core. To let v2rayA use v2ray as its core, edit the v2raya service file:

```sh
sudo systemctl edit --full v2raya.service
```
then add environment variable `V2RAYA_V2RAY_PATH` in the `[Service]` section:

```ini
[Service]
Environment="V2RAYA_V2RAY_PATH=/usr/bin/v2ray"
```

Don't remove other existing lines and make sure you have v2ray installed in your system, then  restart v2rayA:

```sh
sudo systemctl restart v2raya.service
```
